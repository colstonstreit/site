            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Colston Streit, and I'm a junior at Purdue University. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with minors in Statistics, Biological Sciences, and Psychology. Additionally, for my CS major, I'm concentrating in Software Engineering, Systems Programming, and Security.</p>
            <p>Things I like to do in my spare time include programming (on my own projects), playing tennis or ping pong, reading (especially fantasy or sci-fi), playing video games (the Zelda series is my favorite), and playing the piano. </p>
            <p>Programming is the biggest of these, at least when I have time to do stuff for fun on the side. I'm at least somewhat familiar with many different programming languages or frameworks, which I've listed below in descending order of familiarity.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Java</li>
              <li>C</li>
              <li>C++</li>
              <li>Javascript</li>
              <li>Python</li>
              <li>HTML/CSS</li>
              <li>SQL</li>
              <li>React.js</li>
              <li>C#</li>
              <li>R</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also have experience with various programs like Unity and Blender, and I'm very familiar with the Microsoft Office and Google suites of applications. Even if I haven't used some of these recently, however, I'm still a very quick and eager learner, so I'm confident I could figure out whatever someone needed me to do even if it required using a new tool. Learning new things is one of my favorite hobbies! :)</p>

           <h2>About This Site</h2>
           <p>As I worked carefully to choose what would be best to include on my resume, I was struck by an idea: what if I just made my own website so that recruiters could see everything if they wanted to? That's essentially the goal of this website, though it is not even close to finished right now.</p>
           <p>Eventually, I plan on having a page to show my resume, a page describing the various projects I've worked on, a page detailing my work experience, a page detailing my coursework, a page where I can just post whatever updates I'd like to share (somewhat like a blog), and finally a contact page. These will align (eventually) with the tabs in the upper navigation bar.</p>
           <p>Unfortunately, right now, this page is all that is functional. My next plan is to create a coursework page where I can post all of the different courses I've taken rather than only the two or three I included on my resume. I'm hoping that this will help to make me a more promising candidate... Plus, it's good to practice my HTML and CSS, even if my design skills are lacking! :)</p>
           <p>Overall, though, this is my website! I hope you enjoy and that it helps you to learn a little more about me!</p>
