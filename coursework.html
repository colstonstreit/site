              <h3>CS 25200 - Systems Programming</h3>
              <p><b>Current Grade:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 4.00. Low-level programming; review of addresses, pointers, memory layout, and data representation; text,
              data, and bss segments; debugging and hex dumps; concurrent execution with threads and processes; address spaces; file
              names; descriptors and file pointers; inheritance; system calls and library functions; standard I/O and string
              libraries; simplified socket programming; building tools to help programmers; make and make files; shell scripts and
              quoting; unix tools including sed, echo, test, and find; scripting languages such as awk; version control; object and
              executable files (.o and a.out); symbol tables; pointers to functions; hierarchical directories; and DNS hierarchy;
              programming embedded systems.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>I've really enjoyed this course so far. The programming assignments have been very challenging, and I've enjoyed that. Currently, we're
                implementing our own Shell, and I've found it to be really fun - it turns out that's about the only assignment I've been motivated to work on. :)
                This is easily my favorite class this semester, and it has only made me want to pursue the Systems Programming track even more.

              <p><b>Current Grade:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. An introduction to the methods and tools of software engineering; software life cycle; specification
              and design of software, software testing, cost and effort estimation; laboratory exercises with design, testing, and
              other tools.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>While I certainly recognize the value of this course, given how essential it is to most software jobs out there today, this has
                turned out to be my least favorite class. I've enjoyed learning about design patterns - things I can actually use to help improve
                the quality of my code - but the excess of documentation necessary at every step has grown cumbersome after a while. However, I have
                really enjoyed working on the group project that makes up most of this course. I ended up with really good group members, and we're
                currently in the progress of making a web app where you can meet up with people around you to work on coursework together. I've learned
                a lot (improved my HTML/CSS and Javascript, improved my Python, learned about React.js and Flask), and I'm very grateful for that. I just
                wish we weren't overloaded with a new document of some kind (whether that be for our project or for extra homework piled on) every few days.

              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. File organization and index structures; object-oriented database languages; the relational database
              model with introductions to SQL and DBMS; hierarchical models and network models with introductions to HDDL, HDML, and
              DBTG Codasyl; data mining; data warehousing; database connectivity; distributed databases; the client/server paradigm;
              middleware, including ODBC, JDBC, CORBA, and MOM.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This course has been pretty interesting for me. I hadn't had experience with SQL prior to taking it, so I enjoyed writing queries
                to solve the sometimes-very-difficult homework problems. Relational algebra problems were also pretty neat. There's also a big group
                project for this course, though it's nowhere near as intensive as CS 30700 (which is nice). We haven't started working yet, but I think I ended up with
                a good group. We're planning on making a site that has something to do with which streaming services you can watch which movies on. It's mostly
                just to make us practice our newfound database knowledge. Should be fun!

              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. General principles of children’s behavior and development, from conception to adolescence, including

              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This is one of the last two psychology courses I decided to take to complete my minor. I've enjoyed it for the most part so far. I have a very energetic
                professor which makes paying attention much easier in class. There aren't any exams in this course, just big quizzes that cumulatively are worth a significant
                portion of my grade. That's made it pretty stress-free, though I spend quite a lot of time writing extremely long answers to all of the five-questions-in-one short
                answer questions he likes to give us on the quizzes and discussion posts. I've learned a lot of interesting stuff, though! It makes me excited to apply it
                someday when I'm a parent.

              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. This course will provide a broad survey of research on human sexuality from a psychosocial
              perspective. Topics covered include research methods, gender identity, sexual orientation, reproductive anatomy, typical
              and atypical sexual behavior, and sexual difficulties and their treatments.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This is the other of the two psychology courses I decided to take to complete my minor. It's fully online even though things with COVID-19 are mostly calming down,
                which I know bothers some people... but I enjoy working online. I can do things a lot more at my own pace, and that's certainly held true for this class. The course is
                divided into four modules that are each released after the previous one's exam. So far, I've simply sat down when the next module comes out and knocked the whole thing out
                in a day. Of course, it means I have to review a bunch before the exam a month later, but it's nice not to have to even think about the class in the meantime. That said, it's
                been a very interesting class! I ultimately opted to take it because my mom took something similar in college and said it was one of her favorite classes. I think it'd be more
                fun if it was in person, but even with it being online, it's been very enjoyable, and I think I've learned a lot!

                I've always loved probability problems, and there have been a lot of cool ones in this course! Plus, I haven't really had
                the chance to learn about using calculus with regards to probability, as well as what moment generating functions are, so
                it's all been very enjoyable. I always love a good math class!

              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This was my least favorite class in the Spring 2021 semester but only because I get so nervous about speaking in front of people... or at least about being graded while doing so. I
                do feel as though I improved my public speaking skills throughout the semester, but it was still a very stressful time. I spent more time
                preparing for speeches in this class than I did on homework for any of my other classes, even though the other classes were likely
                objectively harder. Writing and speaking just aren't very fun for me! I'm good at them, but I don't enjoy it.

              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This was easily my favorite class in the Spring 2021 semester even though it was probably close to my hardest. This course is
                packed with new information that none of the previous CS courses cover, and I enjoyed learning all of it. I was sad that I had to take
                this course online, as it meant I had to miss out on the hardware labs where we would wire breadboard circuits, something I've always
                wanted to do. Thankfully, now (in Fall 2021) I'm actually a TA for this course, so I've now been able to enjoy that part of the course too.
                Overall, one of the best and most interesting courses I've ever taken. I even enjoyed learning Assembly... crazy, right? It was super challenging,
                but very worth it and very satisfying to get it working. Also, a big shoutout to Professor Adams, too - he's an amazing lecturer, even online.

              <p>I really enjoyed this course as well. While there was a lot less new content than in CS 25000, I still really enjoyed learning all about
                various data structures and algorithms, as well as the process of implementing them for homework assignemnts. Making various traversal algorithms
                (DFS, BFS) for random scenarios (like finding the coastline of a beach using BFS for one project) was really enjoyable. I don't think I'll ever not
                enjoy a class with fun programming problems. I also felt like I learned a lot of content that would help me in the future to pass coding interviews
                and get a job - we really analyzed time and space complexity of various algorithms or data structures in much more detail than previous courses did.
                I'm very grateful for that.

              <p>This was probably up there as one of my harder courses this semester. I'd never had experience with proof-based math, so I was very anxious at first to
                take this class. However, I felt like I got used to the process of proving things fairly quickly. The hardest part was simply preparing for the exams because
                how I did really just depended on the questions he asked... I would either quickly be able to figure them out, or I wouldn't. Thankfully, most of the time it
                was the former, but it was very stressful. I'm very proud of how I did overall. This course completed my math minor, but now I'm thinking about doing a math major as well...
                so I guess I'd better keep up the proof skills! :)

              <p>This might have been the most interesting psychology course that I took for the minor. Mental disorders have run throughout most
                of my family, so I really enjoyed being able to learn about all of the different theories trying to figure out why some people are more
                likely to develop mental disorders than others, how we can help to prevent them, etc. It was really interesting, and also probably the most
                rigorous of the psychology courses I've taken. The professor was also fantastic, even online. I really enjoyed this course.

              <p>While COM 21700 might have been the most stressful course for me, this course was the one that irritated me most this semester. I came in already
                frustrated because I'd taken AP Statistics in high school and had learned much of the content covered by this course already, but for whatever reason
                Purdue wouldn't take that credit. So most of the semester was just review - I think the only new thing I learned was how ANOVA worked. The course was also
                very disorganized as a whole, and they wanted us to show all our work on online exams, even if that meant typing integrals into a plain text box... it was
                not very fun. I'm just glad I got through it.

                so far (through Fall 2021). I absolutely love biology and actually came to Purdue initially with that in mind (my initial major was Neurobiology
                and Physiology) but I decided that research wasn't the way to go, and being a doctor didn't sound like the kind of lifestyle I wanted. This course
                completed my minor in Biological Sciences that I opted for instead, and it took a lot of work! This course covered so much content - all of it interesting,
                of course - but it took a lot of effort to keep myself from forgetting it. Of all exams I've taken, those for this class stressed me out the most. Thankfully,
                it turned out all good. My professor also loved tennis and would make all of the course content relevant to it, and that always made it more fun too. :)

              <h3>CS 18200 - Foundations of Computer Science</h3>
              <p><b>Grade Obtained:</b> A+</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. Logic and proofs; sets, functions, relations, sequences and summations; number representations;
              counting; fundamentals of the analysis of algorithms; graphs and trees; proof techniques; recursion; Boolean logic;
              finite state machines; pushdown automata; computability and undecidability.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This course wasn't too bad. It introduced a lot of content that I found very interesting, like graphs, proof techniques, more
                formal approaches to recursion, finite state machines, etc. There were also a lot of cool probability / counting problems that I really
                enjoyed. Overall, the course wasn't very difficult... it was just very disorganized, and the tests were (in my opinion) poorly worded which was frustrating to say the least.
                It worked out, though. There was also a cool project where we had to color a graph with the minimum number of colors, and I really enjoyed that - I even went above and beyond and actually used Swing in Java to automatically generate
                and color a graph based on its adjacency matrix. I had a lot of fun with it.

              <h3>CS 24000 - Programming in C</h3>
              <p><b>Grade Obtained:</b> A+</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. The UNIX environment, C development cycle, data representation, operators, program structure,
              recursion, macros, C preprocessor, pointers and addresses, dynamic memory allocation, structures, unions, typedef,
              bit-fields, pointer/structure applications, UNIX file abstraction, file access, low-level I/O, concurrency.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>I'd been very nervous to take this course because one of my best friends in high school had primarily used C++, and he had always complained to me about how
                confusing pointers were - you could even have pointers to pointers, or, better yet, pointers to pointers to pointers! I wasn't ready to deal with that in this class,
                but I actually ended up really enjoying everything this course had to offer. C has become easily my favorite programming language after Java, and I feel very comfortable
                with it and with memory manipulation now. Even pointers make sense to me! :) My favorite part of this course, however, was the final project: we had to implement a MIDI parser
                and editor. They gave us very little guidance on this project compared with previous homework assignments, so I spent a lot of time happily researching the MIDI File
                specification and implementing it with code. We also had to make various editing functionality, like giving the user the ability to move a note up an octave or change the instrument
                for a certain track, or even change the tempo. I had a lot of fun downloading random MIDI files off the internet and passing them through my program to make them sound funny.
                Overall, one of my favorite classes that I've taken so far.

              <h3>HIST 35205 - Death, Disease, and Medicine in 20th Century American History</h3>
              <p><b>Grade Obtained:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. This course examines the history of disease, dying, and medicine in the United States in the 20th
              century.</i>
              </p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>As someone minoring in Biological Sciences, you can imagine my delight when I realized there was a course I could took that would simulataneously satisfy three different
                gen-ed requirements while also being about something very interesting to me: disease. In this course, there were not any tests (thankfully) but instead several books we had to
                read and essays we had to write over each of them to reflect on what we'd learned. The books covered landmark diseases throughout history like polio, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and many
                others, and I found the history of it to be very interesting. Learning about the vaccine debates at the time of these epidemics was made even more interesting by the clear
                connection to the time of this semester, right in the middle of COVID-19 dominating the world. Overall, there couldn't have been a better time to take this class, and I really enjoyed it.
                However, it was the closest I've come so far to not getting an A in a class here at Purdue: to get an A in the class, I needed an 83 on my final paper. I ended up getting an 86... I really
                cut it close there, didn't I?! :)

              <h3>HONR 39900 - Music As A Chariot</h3>
              <p><b>Grade Obtained:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. “This course is for students who are keenly interested in
              exploring the relationship between the experience of music in life and the ideas attached
              to it. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the evolutionary principles at work
              in music and theatre, and to introduce them to an aesthetic vocabulary of design
              elements based on that evolution that is useful in both visual and auditory design and
              music composition. By the end of this semester, students should be able to articulate an
              individual aesthetic regarding the art of sound, and identify elements of color, mass, time,
              space, and line in sound scores and compositions.</i>
              </p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This was a really interesting course that I wouldn't normally have taken, but decided to in order to satisfy an
                Honors College requirement. And I'm very glad I did! This class was held synchronously online and was the smallest class size I've had here at Purdue: right around 16 people.
                Over the semester, we grew close in a way that other classes didn't allow for. Each week consisted of reading a chapter from the book, responding to questions from it, and then
                making some kind of project. Often these included finding an example of a musical concept (the startle reflex) in a movie, but others involved trying to compose something of our own.
                I spent a lot of time on this class, but overall, it was very rewarding. I'm glad I took it!

              <h3>PSY 22200 - Introduction to Behavioral Neuroscience</h3>
              <p><b>Grade Obtained:</b> A+</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. An introduction to how the nervous system controls behavior. Topics include evolution and
              comparative psychobiology, the neuroscience of sensation and perception, the neuroscience of motivation,
              neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience.</i>
              </p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This was the first real psychology course I ever took (I studied with my friend for the AP Psychology test that gave me credit for the prerequisite rather than take the actual class),
                and I really enjoyed it! Since I really liked neuroscience, it was fun to be able to learn a bit more about all of the different hormones and neurotransmitters that affect how we think,
                how we feel, and all kinds of other things. Overall, not a very intensive course - the hardest part was simply writing a few informal essays - but a good one nonetheless.
