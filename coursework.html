          <p>This page contains all of the coursework I've had so far, as well as descriptions of what I've had to do for each (and a bit of what I thought about them). Someday I'd like to have multiple ways to sort them (e.g. by course number, subject, chronologically, etc.) but I'll work on that later.</p>

            <section id="CS25200">
              <h3>CS 25200 - Systems Programming</h3>
              <p><b>Current Grade:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 4.00. Low-level programming; review of addresses, pointers, memory layout, and data representation; text,
              data, and bss segments; debugging and hex dumps; concurrent execution with threads and processes; address spaces; file
              names; descriptors and file pointers; inheritance; system calls and library functions; standard I/O and string
              libraries; simplified socket programming; building tools to help programmers; make and make files; shell scripts and
              quoting; unix tools including sed, echo, test, and find; scripting languages such as awk; version control; object and
              executable files (.o and a.out); symbol tables; pointers to functions; hierarchical directories; and DNS hierarchy;
              programming embedded systems.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>I've really enjoyed this course so far. The programming assignments have been very challenging, and I've enjoyed that. Currently, we're
                implementing our own Shell, and I've found it to be really fun - it turns out that's about the only assignment I've been motivated to work on. :)
                This is easily my favorite class this semester, and it has only made me want to pursue the Systems Programming track even more.

              <h3>CS 30700 - Software Engineering I</h3>
              <p><b>Current Grade:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. An introduction to the methods and tools of software engineering; software life cycle; specification
              and design of software, software testing, cost and effort estimation; laboratory exercises with design, testing, and
              other tools.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>While I certainly recognize the value of this course, given how essential it is to most software jobs out there today, this has
                turned out to be my least favorite class. I've enjoyed learning about design patterns - things I can actually use to help improve
                the quality of my code - but the excess of documentation necessary at every step has grown cumbersome after a while. However, I have
                really enjoyed working on the group project that makes up most of this course. I ended up with really good group members, and we're
                currently in the progress of making a web app where you can meet up with people around you to work on coursework together. I've learned
                a lot (improved my HTML/CSS and Javascript, improved my Python, learned about React.js and Flask), and I'm very grateful for that. I just
                wish we weren't overloaded with a new document of some kind (whether that be for our project or for extra homework piled on) every few days.

              <h3>CS 34800 - Information Systems</h3>
              <p><b>Current Grade:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. File organization and index structures; object-oriented database languages; the relational database
              model with introductions to SQL and DBMS; hierarchical models and network models with introductions to HDDL, HDML, and
              DBTG Codasyl; data mining; data warehousing; database connectivity; distributed databases; the client/server paradigm;
              middleware, including ODBC, JDBC, CORBA, and MOM.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This course has been pretty interesting for me. I hadn't had experience with SQL prior to taking it, so I enjoyed writing queries
                to solve the sometimes-very-difficult homework problems. Relational algebra problems were also pretty neat. There's also a big group
                project for this course, though it's nowhere near as intensive as CS 30700 (which is nice). We haven't started working yet, but I think I ended up with
                a good group. We're planning on making a site that has something to do with which streaming services you can watch which movies on. It's mostly
                just to make us practice our newfound database knowledge. Should be fun!

              <h3>PSY 23500 - Child Psychology</h3>
              <p><b>Current Grade:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. General principles of childrenâ€™s behavior and development, from conception to adolescence, including
              sensory and motor development, and basic psychological processes such as learning, motivation, and socialization.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This is one of the last two psychology courses I decided to take to complete my minor. I've enjoyed it for the most part so far. I have a very energetic
                professor which makes paying attention much easier in class. There aren't any exams in this course, just big quizzes that cumulatively are worth a significant
                portion of my grade. That's made it pretty stress-free, though I spend quite a lot of time writing extremely long answers to all of the five-questions-in-one short
                answer questions he likes to give us on the quizzes and discussion posts. I've learned a lot of interesting stuff, though! It makes me excited to apply it
                someday when I'm a parent.

            <section id="PSY24400">
              <h3>PSY 24400 - Introduction to Human Sexuality</h3>
              <p><b>Current Grade:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. This course will provide a broad survey of research on human sexuality from a psychosocial
              perspective. Topics covered include research methods, gender identity, sexual orientation, reproductive anatomy, typical
              and atypical sexual behavior, and sexual difficulties and their treatments.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This is the other of the two psychology courses I decided to take to complete my minor. It's fully online even though things with COVID-19 are mostly calming down,
                which I know bothers some people... but I enjoy working online. I can do things a lot more at my own pace, and that's certainly held true for this class. The course is
                divided into four modules that are each released after the previous one's exam. So far, I've simply sat down when the next module comes out and knocked the whole thing out
                in a day. Of course, it means I have to review a bunch before the exam a month later, but it's nice not to have to even think about the class in the meantime. That said, it's
                been a very interesting class! I ultimately opted to take it because my mom took something similar in college and said it was one of her favorite classes. I think it'd be more
                fun if it was in person, but even with it being online, it's been very enjoyable, and I think I've learned a lot!

              <h3>STAT 41600 - Probability</h3>
              <p><b>Current Grade:</b> A</p>
              <h4>Course Description:</h4>
              <p><i>Credit Hours: 3.00. (MA 41600) An introduction to mathematical probability suitable as preparation for actuarial
              science, statistical theory, and mathematical modeling. General probability rules, conditional probability and Bayes
              theorem, discrete and continuous random variables, moments and moment generating functions, joint and conditional
              distributions, standard discrete and continuous distributions and their properties, law of large numbers and central
              limit theorem.</i></p>
              <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
              <p>This has probably been my second favorite class this semester. The lectures have admittedly been kind of boring, but
                I've always loved probability problems, and there have been a lot of cool ones in this course! Plus, I haven't really had
                the chance to learn about using calculus with regards to probability, as well as what moment generating functions are, so
                it's all been very enjoyable. I always love a good math class!
